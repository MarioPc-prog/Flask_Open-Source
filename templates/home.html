					<p style= "color: white;"> All Spartans are great warriors. We train from birth. Our lives were discipline, duty, battle, and death. Life was grim, and we greeted it grimly.But Atreus of Sparta was unlike the rest of us. He wore a smile even in the worst of times. He was… happy. He inspired us to hope… that though we were machines of war, yet there was humanity in us. Goodness. When the day came for him to lay down his life in battle, his sacrifice saved countless others, and turned the tide in our favour. I carried him home on his shield, and buried him with all the honours of Spartan custom. His memory was a comfort in dark times.</p>
